# Introduction

WSL and ZFS in the same sentence? Clickbait! ... well, if it was just few months ago I would have said: totally.

But we are "in the now", and not only you will see it applied, but we will move to the Linux Kernel 5.x version (stream?).

Should I go on or it's enough that you want me to shut-up and just show the how-to? That's what I thought.

Follow the Corsair into this brand new Ocean.

# Prerequisites

As usual, here is the full list of the prerequisites:

- Windows 10 Insiders Fast v19587+
- [WSL2 enabled](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-install) and a distro installed - I will use [Pengwin](https://www.whitewaterfoundry.com/) during this howto
- `config-wsl` kernel config file from the [WSL2 Kernel repo](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel/tree/master/Microsoft)
- The latest stable Kernel - [5.5.10](https://www.kernel.org/) at the time of the writing
- The latest ZFS source - [v0.8.3](https://zfsonlinux.org/) at the time of the writing

# Kernel 5.x: WSL is Linux

In order to be able to use ZFS, we first need to build a Kernel containing the module. So before continuing, ensure you have downloaded the prerequisites.

Let's login into our WSL2 shell:

![image-20200322143642177](../../../assets/images/wsl2-kernel-original.png)

As shown in the screenshot, Pengwin actually displays which Kernel we are currently running on.

If you do not see it or you are using another distro, then type `uname -a` to see it.

Before we build the Kernel, we need first to add the ZFS module.

## ZFS: building the zeta module

Before we can build the module, we need, well, build tools and the potential dependencies.

Thankfully, the OpenZFS community is incredible, and an howto has [already been done](https://forum.level1techs.com/t/building-custom-kernel-with-zfs-built-in/117464) for an older version, so we will need to adapt it a bit. Let's go into our WSL2 shell:

```bash
# Extract the ZFS archive
tar -xzf zfs-0.8.3.tar.gz
# Extract the Kernel archive
tar -xJf linux-5.5.10.tar.xz
```

![image-20200322154245000](../../../assets/images/wsl2-kernel-zfs-extract.png)

```bash
# Install the build tools and the dependencies
sudo apt install -yqq build-essential autoconf automake libtool gawk alien fakeroot dkms libblkid-dev uuid-dev libudev-dev libssl-dev \
zlib1g-dev libaio-dev libattr1-dev libelf-dev python3 python3-dev python3-setuptools python3-cffi libffi-dev flex bison
```

![image-20200322154419391](../../../assets/images/wsl2-kernel-zfs-packages-install.png)

Once the packages installed, we need first to copy the `config-wsl` inside the Kernel source and run `make prepare scripts`:

```bash
# Copy the config-wsl file
cp config-wsl linux-5.5.10/.config
# Enter the kernel directory and prepare the scripts
cd linux-5.5.10
make prepare scripts
# Here is the full list of the options and the answers I gave which where not the default > feel free to answer to differently based on your own knowledge
TSX enable mode
> 1. off (X86_INTEL_TSX_MODE_OFF) (NEW)
  2. on (X86_INTEL_TSX_MODE_ON) (NEW)
  3. auto (X86_INTEL_TSX_MODE_AUTO) (NEW)
choice[1-3?]: 1

vsyscall table for legacy applications
  1. Full emulation (LEGACY_VSYSCALL_EMULATE)
  2. Emulate execution only (LEGACY_VSYSCALL_XONLY) (NEW)
> 3. None (LEGACY_VSYSCALL_NONE)
choice[1-3?]: 1

IPv4/IPV6 bridge connection tracking support (NF_CONNTRACK_BRIDGE) [N/m/y/?] (NEW) y

DM "dm-mod.create=" parameter support (DM_INIT) [N/y/?] (NEW) y

Virtio Filesystem (VIRTIO_FS) [N/m/y/?] (NEW) y

UTF-8 normalization and casefolding support (UNICODE) [N/y/?] (NEW) y
```

![image-20200322160428320](../../../assets/images/wsl2-kernel-prepare.png)

Once the `prepare` finished, we can build the ZFS module:

```bash
# Enter the ZFS directory
cd ../zfs-0.8.3/
# Run the autogen.sh script
sh autogen.sh
```

![image-20200322162215959](../../../assets/images/wsl2-kernel-zfs-autogen.png)

```bash
# Run the configure script
./configure --prefix=/ --libdir=/lib --includedir=/usr/inc
lude --datarootdir=/usr/share --enable-linux-builtin=yes --with-linux=${HOME}/wslkernel5/linux-5.5.10 --with-linux-obj=${HOME}/wslkernel5/linux-5.5.10
```

![image-20200322162614572](../../../assets/images/wsl2-kernel-zfs-configure.png)

```bash
# Run the copy-builtin script
./copy-builtin ${HOME}/wslkernel5/linux-5.5.10
```

![image-20200322162856910](../../../assets/images/wsl2-kernel-zfs-cpy-builtin.png)

The module has been added to the Kernel sources and we can now enable it.

But before we do that, with all the work done, let's install the ZFS binaries:

```bash
# Build ZFS
make
# Install the binaries in your system
sudo make install
# Run the command zfs to see if it's installed and show the help
zfs
# Try to see which version is installed
zfs version
```

![image-20200322163632779](../../../assets/images/wsl2-kernel-zfs-make-install.png)

And an error appeared, but that's OK. This is "good" error and we will fix it in the next section.

## Kernel: build the future

We are finally back on the "kernel building track", and before we can run the so much wanted `make` (and have a more or less long pause), let's first change the `config` file and add the reference to the ZFS build:

```bash
# Enter the kernel directory
cd ../linux-5.5.10/
# Check if a ZFS reference already exist in the config file
grep ZFS .config
# Add the ZFS reference to the end of the config file
echo "CONFIG_ZFS=y" >> .config
# Confirm it has been correctly added
tail .config
```

![image-20200322165306309](../../../assets/images/wsl2-kernel-zfs-config-reference.png)

Finally, the time is here to ~~take a pause~~ to build the kernel:

```bash
# As we have a .config file, just run make > no need of the KCONFIG as instructed in WSL2 Kernel repo
make
```

![image-20200322172828214](../../../assets/images/wsl2-kernel-make.png)

We have now our brand new kernel v5 with the ZFS module embedded.

Before we move on, let's install the modules:

```bash
# Install the modules built with the Kernel
sudo make modules_install
```



Now the last piece, we need to use it for our WSL2 distros.

## WSL2: The future is now

Ok, let's setup our custom Kernel:

```bash
# Create a directory on "Windows" path to store the kernel
mkdir /mnt/c/wslkernel5
# Copy the Kernel file
cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage /mnt/c/wslkernel5/kernel
# Edit the wslconfig file and add the Kernel setting
vi /mnt/c/Users/<username>/.wslconfig
```

![image-20200322174209994](../../../assets/images/wsl2-kernel-wslconfig.png)

Exit your WSL2 shell and start Powershell as an administrator:

```bash
# Shutdown the WSL2 VM
wsl --shutdown
# Restart the LXSS process
Restart-Service LxssManager
```

![image-20200322174512264](../../../assets/images/wsl2-kernel-powershell-wsl2-shutdown.png)

We can finally start again our WSL2 shell and enjoy the new Kernel with ZFS:

```bash
# Check the ZFS version installed
zfs version
```

![image-20200322174934661](../../../assets/images/wsl2-kernel-zfs-installed.png)



# Conclusion

For the ones still doubting: WSL2 is growing at a (crazy) fast pace. And all the build work was made inside WSL2, without any need of a VM or bare metal Linux.

Having the possibility to use the latest kernel, to had modules is something that some persons might have been looking for, and now it became a reality.

I hope you enjoyed this new gem from the Corsair's chest and see you soon in the vast Linux Ocean ... I simply have different ship.

# Bonus: one Kernel to rule them all

oh sorry, you thought I was done? well almost, but I wanted to share one last trick.

As you may know (or not), all the distros installed under **your** user are running in the same microVM. Therefore the kernel and the ZFS module are also available to all the distros.

So, for all my Arch (based) distro loving friends:

Enjoy :)
